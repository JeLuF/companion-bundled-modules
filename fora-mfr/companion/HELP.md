## ACTIONS

    * Implemented
        >   Router config

            -   Apply preset video format
            -   Cancel preset video format

    * ToDo (?)
        >   Switching operation
            -   reinitialize unit ( advise caution )


## FEEDBACKS

    * Implemented
        - Routed destination ( true if selected source is routed to this destination xpt - blinbks if selected destination is not routed to selected source)

## COMMAND REFERENCE

## For.A MFR Series 3G/HD/SD/ASI Routing Switchers

     * Basic specification
         -   Port number 49152 - 65534 (default : 23)
         -   Maximum clients : 16
         -   Wait for Echo before sending next command
         -   No password required

## Commands available by connecting using LAN

\*1 When commands are sent via LAN, an Echo, Prompt, S response and other response messages may be included in a single packet or divided into two or more packets. Therefore, do not process commands in a per packet basis but a per stream basis.

\*2 A command protocol should be selected in the [Web-based Control: Port Settings page].

If "Crosspoint remote control 2" is not enabled some functionality is not available.

     *2  To enable "Crosspoint remote control 2" commands
         -   navigate to the switcher's web interface;
             System Settings > Router System Settings > Port Settings
         -   In the TCP/IP section set "Default Function" to "Crosspoint remote control 2"
         -   In the Command Response section make sure that Echo, C and S responses are checked
         -   Send changes in order to save changes to system
