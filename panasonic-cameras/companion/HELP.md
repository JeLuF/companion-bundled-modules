# Panasonic Cameras

Companion module for Panasonic's IP remote controllable cameras. It supports all AW series PTZ cameras as well as camera models AG-CX350, AG-CX200, AJ-CX4000, AJ-UPX360, AJ-UPX900 and AK-UB300, which use the same remote control protocol.

**_Not all models supports all actions, variables and feedbacks. But it should be auto sorted so that you can only use actions, feedbacks, variables and presets that works with your model._**

For additional features not yet supported by this module, please raise a feature request on [GitHub](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion-module-panasonic-cameras/).
